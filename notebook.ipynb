{"cells":[{"source":"![dvd_image](dvd_image.jpg)\n\nA DVD rental company needs your help! They want to figure out how many days a customer will rent a DVD for based on some features and has approached you for help. They want you to try out some regression models which will help predict the number of days a customer will rent a DVD for. The company wants a model which yeilds a MSE of 3 or less on a test set. The model you make will help the company become more efficient inventory planning.\n\nThe data they provided is in the csv file `rental_info.csv`. It has the following features:\n- `\"rental_date\"`: The date (and time) the customer rents the DVD.\n- `\"return_date\"`: The date (and time) the customer returns the DVD.\n- `\"amount\"`: The amount paid by the customer for renting the DVD.\n- `\"amount_2\"`: The square of `\"amount\"`.\n- `\"rental_rate\"`: The rate at which the DVD is rented for.\n- `\"rental_rate_2\"`: The square of `\"rental_rate\"`.\n- `\"release_year\"`: The year the movie being rented was released.\n- `\"length\"`: Lenght of the movie being rented, in minuites.\n- `\"length_2\"`: The square of `\"length\"`.\n- `\"replacement_cost\"`: The amount it will cost the company to replace the DVD.\n- `\"special_features\"`: Any special features, for example trailers/deleted scenes that the DVD also has.\n- `\"NC-17\"`, `\"PG\"`, `\"PG-13\"`, `\"R\"`: These columns are dummy variables of the rating of the movie. It takes the value 1 if the move is rated as the column name and 0 otherwise. For your convinience, the reference dummy has already been dropped.","metadata":{},"id":"b4ae5707-109f-4cd6-8168-88cac0179d6b","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import Lasso\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error as MSE\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV\n# Import any additional modules and start coding below\nrental_info = pd.read_csv(\"rental_info.csv\")\n#print(rental_info.head())\nrental_info[\"rental_length\"] = pd.to_datetime(rental_info[\"return_date\"]) - pd.to_datetime(rental_info[\"rental_date\"])\nrental_info[\"rental_length_days\"] = rental_info[\"rental_length\"].dt.days\n#print(rental_info[\"rental_length_days\"])\nrental_info[\"deleted_scenes\"] = np.where(rental_info[\"special_features\"].str.contains(\"Deleted Scenes\"),1,0)\nrental_info[\"behind_the_scenes\"] = np.where(rental_info[\"special_features\"].str.contains(\"Behind the Scenes\"),1,0)\n#print(rental_info[[\"Deleted_Scenes\",\"behind_the_scenes\"]])\ncols_to_drop = [\"special_features\", \"rental_length\", \"rental_length_days\", \"rental_date\", \"return_date\"]\nX = rental_info.drop(cols_to_drop, axis = 1)\ny = rental_info[\"rental_length_days\"]\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X,y, test_size = 0.2, random_state = 9)\nlasso = Lasso(alpha = 0.1, random_state=9)\nlasso.fit(X_train, y_train)\nlasso_coef = lasso.coef_\nX_lasso_train, X_lasso_test = X_train.iloc[:,lasso_coef > 0], X_test.iloc[:,lasso_coef > 0]\nols = LinearRegression()\nols.fit(X_lasso_train, y_train)\ny_pred = ols.predict(X_lasso_test)\nols_MSE = np.sqrt(MSE(y_test, y_pred))\nprint(\"Mean Squared error of linear regression\", ols_MSE)\nrf = RandomForestRegressor()\nparam_rf= {'n_estimators': np.arange(1,101,1),\n          'max_depth' : np.arange(1,11,1)}\ngrid_rf = RandomizedSearchCV(rf, \n                                 param_distributions=param_rf, \n                                 cv=5, \n                                 random_state=9\n)\ngrid_rf.fit(X_train, y_train)\ngrid_rf_best_model = grid_rf.best_estimator_\ngrid_rf_best_model.fit(X_train, y_train)\ngrid_rf_best_model_pred = grid_rf_best_model.predict(X_test)\ngrid_rf_best_model_MSE = np.sqrt(MSE(y_test, grid_rf_best_model_pred))\nprint(\"Mean Squared error of Randomized CV Search\", grid_rf_best_model_MSE)\nhyperparameter_rf = grid_rf.best_params_\nrf = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators = hyperparameter_rf['n_estimators'],\n                          max_depth= hyperparameter_rf['max_depth'],\n                          random_state= 9)\nrf.fit(X_train, y_train)\nrf_pred = rf.predict(X_test)\nrf_MSE = np.sqrt(MSE(y_test, rf_pred))\nprint(\"Mean Squared error of Random Forest\", grid_rf_best_model_MSE)\n\nbest_model = rf\nbest_mse = rf_MSE","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":null,"lastExecutedAt":null,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":null,"outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":77,"type":"stream"}}},"id":"a7ede566-910a-445c-b11a-68d192ac8506","cell_type":"code","execution_count":46,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":"Mean Squared error of linear regression 2.1936948833591794\nMean Squared error of Randomized CV Search 1.4887026900397242\nMean Squared error of Random Forest 1.4887026900397242\n"}]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
